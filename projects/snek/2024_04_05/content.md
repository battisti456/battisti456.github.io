# Grommit problems

![*Img 1*: The printed vertebra with the anvil held in position to demostrate the air gap due to curvature. Attemting to hammer the grommit in like this would likely shatter the plastic.](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/drive-viewer/AKGpihanfLvO_Pmagr1_q27eaXok47ycoK7MzjZQT6ea6dz5HthC4UPsTC8NdO9srS-vZk20K4I2mEzDLovjy5awE4YTV4c901ASAD8=s1600-rw-v1 =200emx*)

When attempting assembly I found that it was too difficult to install the grommit eyeholes needed for the tendons to enter the inside of the vertebra and connect to the motor. The problem can be seen in *Img 1* where a gap between the plastic and the anvil for flattening the grommit means that attempting to set it will result in breaking the plastic. While it might theoretically be possible to procure some sort of curved anvil to match the inside curvature of the vertebra tube, it seemed simpler to alter the vertabra design slightly such that the mount location for the grommit is flat on the inside.

I have altered the design from what is seen in *Img 2* to what is seen in *Img 3*, and am now fabricating the new design.
