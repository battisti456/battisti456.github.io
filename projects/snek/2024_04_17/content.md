# Grommit Problems Continued

Unfortunately, while the design described in the [previous post](/?snek/2024_04_05) did allow for the grommits to be hammered in easily, the grommits were not actually aligned with the tendon between the outside of the next segment and the motor on the inside of the current one. As the steel cable I used didn't slide easily through the grommits this was a problem and I redesigned the vertabrea again so that the grommit set plane would be perpendicular to the tendon. The design ended up with what can be seen in *Img 1*.

![*Img 1*: An image of the new vertebrae design (vert_6 with a big anvil) which angles the grommit to better align with the tendon.](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/drive-viewer/AKGpihbO6UffMDMQLgI6SZdSVwvdM14_JccS4S6w6sNy-ilqqGMkV14STN44KSANjlPSQyxmFk0cmGirb0OIWhb_JRPCsGPIESud1oQ=s2560 =200emx*)

This design, while it didi work, came with several drawbacks. Namely, to leave enough space for the anvil, a large cylidical extrusion needs to be added to the outside of the vertabra, and also, the eangle the grommit mounting plane was at could not be printed as solid in vase printing withous using very small layers (which are weaker). You can see this issue in *Img 2*.

This maybe could be fixed with gluing on a small 3d printed plate to the diconnected strands? It may make it solid enough, but I also had another possible solution. One of the more difficult aspects of designing the print for these grommits has mostly been the size and shape of the anvil I bought for placing them. I realized, however, that by drilling a hole on the end of a metal rod left from some fencing projects, and then tapering the hole a bit with a random tool I found that seemed to work, I could perhaps create a more appropiately shaped anvil. You can see my results pictured between *Img 3* and *Img 4*.

This could maybe allow for a smaller cyllander to be extruded to fit the anvil in and provide the grommit plane. Hopefully tyhe smaller grommit plane might also not suffer as much from being too steep. You can see what this might look like in *Img 5*. Unfortunately, my 3d printer is currently broken, so printing it to see will have to wait.
